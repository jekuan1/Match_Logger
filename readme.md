# Match Logger

#### Match logger my friends and I used (created by me) to track our pool table games

#### I built this website as my friends and I were tracking our pool table matches on a whiteboard with tallies. Although it kept the competition up it wasn't a very good long term solution. I had the idea of locally hosting a website and then created this over the summer. I host it using gunicorn + NGINX on my mac.

#### The system uses an ELO rating system to reward players who are worse for beating better players. I learned a lot about python, flask, and databases.
